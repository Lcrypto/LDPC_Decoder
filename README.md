# LDPC_Decoder
Low Density Parity Check Decoder

This is the LDPC decoder I developed for my ECEN 654 final project. It currently impliments a rate .5 code but is nearly fully parameterised so it could generate decoders for arbitrary H matrices with only minor changes.  
  
It consists of a MATLAB simulation used to verify the algorithm and generate test data for the Verilog implimentation. 

The top level Verilog module is generated by script_LDPC_v, which calls verigen which uses print statements to generate LDPC.v
  
The Verilog generating files have not been refactored so they're rather cumbersome
