This is the LDPC decoder I developed for my ECEN 654 final project.  
  
InitializeWiMaxLDPC.m and a decent portion of script_LDPC.m were provided initially

Call script_LDPC to run the simulation, I've placed comments to indicate some of the changable parameters

I went through a few version of the decoder script in the process of optomizing it.  
  
The Verilog generating files have not been refactored at any point, so they're outdated and are not terse  

The top level Verilog module is generated by script_LDPC_v, which calls verigen which generates the module using prints.
